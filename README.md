Welcome, [Open-Xml-PowerTools](https://github.com/OpenXmlDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools) users. This version of the library is based on SkiaSharp, which replaced System.Drawing.Common, which stops supporting all operating systems except Windows starting with the version .NET 6
Thanks to [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp), Open-Xml-PowerTools has become cross-platform.
